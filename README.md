# Build Windows Installers for a Release of DOSBox-X

This project was created to build the Windows installers for the DOSBox-X
project. It requires that all Windows builds are available for the latest
release of the 
[DOSBox-X project on GitHub](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x).

Please see
[the release page](https://github.com/JoeBroesele/dosbox-x-installers/releases)
for the installer binaries.
